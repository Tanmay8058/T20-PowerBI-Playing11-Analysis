# T20-PowerBI-Playing11-Analysis

- Created a Power BI report to identify top 11 players for a T20 cricket team by scraping data from espncricinfo using brightdata website tool, cleaning and transforming the data with pandas, and evaluating various player performance metrics.
- Used the resulting Power BI dashboard to select players for various categories (openers, middle order, finishers, all-rounders, fast bowlers) and ultimately choose the top 11 players to play in the match.
- Selected team using the Power BI dashboard has highest probability to win the game.
